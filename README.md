# 🧠 Algorithms and Data Structures

Welcome to the **Algorithms and Data Structures** repository! This is a personal collection of classic and advanced solutions to computer science problems, designed for learning, practicing, and referencing core DSA concepts.

## 📚 What's Inside?

This repository is organized by topic and contains both **data structures** and **algorithms**, implemented with clarity and performance in mind.

### 🔩 Data Structures
- Arrays and Strings
- Doubly Circular Linked List
- Stacks & Queues
- Trees (Binary, AVL, Trie and BTree)
- Heaps & Priority Queues
- Hash Tables

### ⚙️ Algorithms
- **Sorting** (Quick, Merge, Heap, Insertion, etc.)
- **Searching** (Binary Search, Linear Search)
- **Recursion & Backtracking**
- **Dynamic Programming**

## 💡 Purpose
This repository is meant for educational purposes, performance comparison, and as a handy reference for algorithm implementation.
